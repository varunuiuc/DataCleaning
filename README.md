In this report farmers market data is analyzed and cleansed to solve some common use cases. 

The tools used in the project are OpenRefine for clustering and refining data, SQLite for relational database, Trifacta Data Wrangler and YesWorkflow for provenance.

URL for the data set:
https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/farmersmarkets

Proposed use case for this dataset is to provide easy access to consumers to clean Farmer market data where they can easily browse trusted data to figure out details of food markets in the area. Consumers can have more details about the farmer markets. 
This data can be fed to other web application or IA engines/automated assistant like Alexa or google voice to make them smarter. This use case is not part of the project but worth mentioning because questions like which markets have organic food zip? 2. Which market are open during night time of 8-11pm? can be answered easily using the clean data set used in this project.
